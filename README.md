# Project Background

The Los Angeles Police Department holds a task force of more than 8,500 sworn officers covering a jurisdiction of over 4 million residents. This dataset published by the LAPD department and used in this project includes a comprehensive summary on incident-level crime in all Los Angeles police districts from the years 2021 to 2023. The purpose of this project was to provide useful insights with an easy-to-use dashboard for anyone interested in understanding more about how crime exists in Los Angeles. This could include residents currently living in the city or even inidividuals who are planning to move to LA and want to know more about each district area. 

Some key objective questions I would like to address are listed below:
- What are the neighborhoods in LA with the highest crime rate?
- Which year, month, or time of day show the highest level of crime activity?
- How long does it take for a crime that was committed to be reported to the police department?
- What is the most targeted age group? Is there a correlation between victim sex and age?
- Which ethnicity was targeted the most? Do the victim's age and ethnicity have a correlation?
- What are the most common types of crime committed? Theft? Battery? Verbal threats? Assult?
- Where do most crimes occur? In a household? At a business? Or in the public?
