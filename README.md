# Project Background

The Los Angeles Police Department holds a task force of more than 8,500 sworn officers covering a jurisdiction of over 4 million residents. This dataset published by the LAPD department and used in this project includes a comprehensive summary on incident-level crime in all Los Angeles counties from the years 2021 to 2023. 

# Executive Summary

What I hope to achieve with this dashboard is to gain insights on what kind of crime 

- What are the neighborhoods in LA with the highest crime rate?
- Which year, month, or even time of day show the highest level of crime activity?
- How long does it take for a crime that was committed to be reported to the police department?
- What is the most targeted age group? Is there a correlation between victim sex and age?
- Which ethnicity was targeted the most? Do the victim's age and ethnicity have a correlation?
- What are the most common types of crime committed? Theft? Battery? Verbal threats?
- Where the most crimes occur? In a household? At a business? Or in the public?
